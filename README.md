The API documentation is available from:
Postman - [https://docs.spacexdata.com](https://docs.spacexdata.com/) 
GitHub - [https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)

Stories:

- As a user, I want the ability to load the full list of SpaceX launches from the SpaceX API
- As a user, I want the ability to reload the data to see any new changes
- As a user, I want the ability to filter the launch list by year
- As a user, I want the ability to sort all launches by date (ascending/descending)

Considerations we will be looking for in your submission are:

- Project approach
- Accuracy of designs
- State management
- Code quality
- Network logic

Please complete the task using a Git source control tool such as GitHub or Bitbucket. Remember to commit your code regularly. And as your submission, please provide access and the URL to the repository.
